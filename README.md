# Tri3Drone
[p1-Drone Deployed Website](https://p1droneapp.herokuapp.com/): We will be transferring our deployment to AWS next week. Had to use Heroku due to technical difficulties with JAR.

[p1-Drone Project Idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XclmN6p6ZTHF3Li8fR3im8bIHbzxoyLGvw0yj-aHqR4/edit?usp=sharing)

[p1-Drone Project Board](https://github.com/aryan114/Tri3Drone/projects/1)

### End Sprint #1 Submission:
* On Project Board, we have smart goals listed for each ticket as check-offs. Descriptions for each ticket is provided below binary grading.
* Commits for each person on their mini-lab can be seen in the branches section. Each scrum-member has their own branch, but these labs have now been deployed into **master**.
* All supplemental links are at the top of the README, including deployed project, and Project Idea with work-assignments for team members.
* Thymeleaf fragments for project can be see in Tri3Drone/src/main/resources/templates/fragments.
* **Mini-Labs** for each scrum member are located on **home-page** of website.

Insertion Sort Lab has 3 approaches: for, while and recursion. Time is tracked using the example method and displayed in the table. Time analysis is displayed with the previous time for the sort, the rolling average of all sorts, and a comparison of the current sort to the rolling average (+/- nano seconds)

Currently, I am working on setting up a rudimentary login system with a default username and password and then link it to a database in a future ticket. I don’t have as many commits as the others but I have lots of code in every commit. However, I will try to commit more frequently as it is better practice.

Same as other team members, due to difficulties when deploying on Heroku the time analysis does not display however it does display when run on local host. Unknown reason for why as of now. Issue should be resolved when project is moved and deployed on AWS/RPI.

### Tickets

##### Backlog Tickets
1. Admin Form Creator UI: Create a UI that admins can use to create forms for their groups.
2. Login/Logout/CreateUser Page: Create UI for users to login and logout and make new users. Need to connect this to database to store the credentials.
3. Spring Security Configuration: Add Spring Security to protect user credentials.
4. Default Hub View (Displays all forms that user can access): Create a Dashboard for the user which will serve as the main landing page. Users will be able to access forms here and admins will be able to make forms here.


##### In Progress Tickets
1. Michael Recursion Lab: Michael's Recursion Lab with base algo insertion sort (see master).
2. Setup Thymeleaf Fragments: Navbar and footer have been added to index.html. Other fragments have been set up, but not added yet.
3. Bootstrap CSS Styling: Used bootstrap code for navbar. Working on implementing bootstrap styling to other areas of the project.
4. User Form Response UI: Create a UI for normal users that would enable them to fill out forms that admins created.


##### Done Tickets
1. Aryan Recursion Lab: Aryan's Factorial Recursion Lab (see master).
2. Pranav Recursion Lab: Pranav's Factorial Recursion Lab (see master).
3. Nakul Recursion Lab: Nakul's Factorial Recursion Lab (see master).
4. Deploy Project Using Heroku: For this week, we are using Heroku for deployment, but we will be switching to AWS next week.
