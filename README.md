### Tickets

##### Backlog Tickets
1. User Form Response UI: Create a UI for normal users that would enable them to fill out forms that admins created.
2. Admin Form Creator UI: Create a UI that admins can use to create forms for their groups.
3. Login/Logout/CreateUser Page: Create UI for users to login and logout and make new users. Need to connect this to database to store the credentials.
